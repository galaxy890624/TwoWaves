# TwoWaves

This is a Python program written in the Visual Studio environment. The following is an explanation of the parameters:


a_wave1: Amplitude of the first wave, measured in meters.

a_wave2: Amplitude of the second wave, measured in meters.

h: Water depth, measured in meters.

T_wave1: Period of the first wave, measured in seconds.

T_wave2: Period of the second wave, measured in seconds.

k_wave1: Wavenumber of the first wave.

k_wave2: Wavenumber of the second wave.

theta_wave1: Phase angle of the first wave.

theta_wave2: Phase angle of the second wave.
